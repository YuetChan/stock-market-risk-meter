- File tree and text editor: Once a project is opened or created, users can view a file tree and a text editor for editing notes associated with files.
- Dangling file searcher: The application provides a search bar and a file list that displays files with dangling notes, which are notes associated with files that are not present in the file tree.
- Auto deletion: When users empty dangling notes, it will remove the associated file from the file list.
